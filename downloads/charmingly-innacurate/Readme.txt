Adjustments to original linework include:

1) a slight rotation to better fit an equidistant conic projection centered at 96W

2) Addition of the District of Columbia

3) Creation of line paths for areas which, on the original map, were obscured by star symbols: the Straits of Mackninac, the Boston area, northern New Hampshire, northern Wisconsin

4) Creation of line paths for areas which were missing on the original map: the IN-OH border, the Ohio border with Lake Erie.
