The linework files below (but not necessarily the example maps) are public domain; use them as you see fit. Please consider giving credit to the author where possible. And please, feel free to drop me a line showing off the maps you’ve made using these. I and the other contributors would like to see these things in action!

Each linework set is distributed as an Esri Shapefile and as an Adobe Illustrator document (complete with projection/scale/coordinates of one point specified in the AI file, so you can reference and reproject it in MAPublisher).

* List item
* another one
* maybe we'll do three
* no four!
