title: Two New Sets!
---

We’re excited to announce **two new linework sets** today: Moriarty Hand, by Dylan Moriarty, and Weekend Update, by Jonah Adkins!

Both are hand-drawn, and provide a quick and easy way to infuse your digital map with the humanity of manual linework. Moriarty Hand is also our second linework set with complete global coverage, and our first hand-drawn one to reach this milestone. From Indonesia to Central America, it’s got you covered.
