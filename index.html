						<p>If you need a simple-looking map, but don't want something smooth and hand-drawn, give Angular a try. Its sharp edges impart a technical, mechanical look of mathematical minimalism. Need an 80s computer style map with green lines on a black background? This is your go-to linework set for retro-techno flare.</p>

						<p>A caricature of the lower 48 United States, this linework set is recognizable and friendly, but not concerned with such stuffy notions as “cartographic accuracy.” It’s that friend you have who’s always embellishing his stories. You never mind his lying, though, because the exaggerations make things more fun. Go ahead, enjoy the story your map is telling.</p>

						<p>Elmer Casual is a hand drawn linework set for select parts of the world. It was originally created by tracing a new set of linework atop standard, geographically-accurate shapefiles pulled from Natural Earth. It lends personality to a map, giving things a unique, informal, handmade feeling. Given the loose nature of the lines, should reproject fairly well into your preferred coordinate system. Originally drawn on a Gall Stereographic projection.</p>

					<div class="description">
						<p>Geo-Metro is constructed entirely of straight lines and circular arcs, reducing areas to a simple geometry. The arcs won’t be perfect circles upon reprojecting (drawn with a Lambert Conformal Conic, parallels 20N/60N), but they should hold up pretty well under a little distortion. Really brings the shapes of the states and countries to people’s attention. Has a modern (or perhaps futuristic), technical, artificial feel.</p>

						<p>Calligraphy and arabesque ornamentation inspired this linework for North America and the US States. It is named after the infinite travels, loops, and tendrils of the woody vines known as lianas. It distinguishes itself by bringing elegance, fantasy, and visual movement to your map.</p>

						<p>Moriarty Hand is a global, hand drawn set of vector linework covering the world's countries, major rivers and lakes, and US states & Canadian provinces, and is available at two scales. It was created by tracing bits and pieces of Natural Earth linework, then filling in the rest by eyeballing a reference map, which makes it both accurate enough to use and inaccurate enough to look human-made. This set does not include TopoJSON files.</p>

					<div class="description">
						<p>Hand-drawn and pleasantly (but not severely) inaccurate, this set of linework calls back to newspaper maps of the pre-digital era. It’s smooth and casual, but authoritative. Can be used to fight dull neutrality in modern maps, or, with the right graphic techniques, can transport a map back to the previous century. Originally drawn on a Mercator projection; should retain its character well when reprojected into your favorite coordinate system.</p>

					<div class="description">
						<p>Named for its abundance of 20- and 70-degree lines, Twenty Seventy is all about being simple, clean, and angular. It has a decidedly technical and digital flavor, while still being functional and personable. Works best when kept in a cylindrical projection, such as Gall Stereographic or Web Mercator.</p>

						<p>Inspired by the design of board game maps, Wargames is built on a field of hexagons. Besides its fun connotations, it can also be used to give a feeling of mathematical abstraction. Clean and simple, it's great for conveying to your audience the idea of data analysis and generalization.</p>

						<p>“Curves,” as Piet Mondrian said, “are so emotional.” The combination of fluid curves and shared straight angles gives this linework set a dynamic feeling. Traced from an original example of Art Deco cartography, it’s perfect for both evoking the interwar period and for more modern celebrations of geometry.</p>
